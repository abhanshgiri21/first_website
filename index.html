                    <article class="articles"><br/>Dell Inspiron 5547 Laptop is one of the best when it comes to best overall performance, build quality and warranty. Dell laptop is built with precision, excellent design and quality. It is fairly balanced in performance with AMD R7 265 and Intel Core i5 processor along with 8 Gigs Ram. If we are not using the Laptop for the purpose of gaming for more than 50% it can be the best buy. The Dell support and warranty is excellent and they help customers with any issues that you face within a reasonable time frame. I would recommend Dell over any other brand considering excellent built quality and service support. If you are buying a laptop for home or office work, Dell 5547 is a great choice.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

There are very few laptops even above 60,000 which offers a FHD screen. This is highly recommended for casual gamers & for students and Home. This is a perfect laptop for watching High definition movies doing programming, reading, making assignments, presentation and working in excel for office.
